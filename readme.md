#Assignment 1

Created expanded table structure , because more logical is to add language details in external table + company and education data are more usefull if they have start end dates and companies listed. It makes MVP bit longer to build , but might reduce Tehnical Dept... might.

Added SQL file `database/sql/database.sql` and laravel migration files `database/migration`

#Assignment 2
This is actually too popular task (I suggest to change it) - for a last 3 years I have done it 3 times already . It even has already CheatSheet for popular languages in (rosettacode)[https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/FizzBuzz].

Added PHP file in `public/foobar.php`

#Assignment 3
`public/worktime.php` - Class for exec and execution included in one file. No UnitTests ( but you did not ask too...). It is not suitable (not testet , but I know issues) for people working over 24 hours
